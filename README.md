# COMPY.PIPE

Simple file based pipe for communication between a python script and MS-DOS .COM program.

*NOTE: The example .asm file only has code to **WRITE** to the pipe. But you can easily modify the loop to read from the pipe as well.*

You can use [emu8086](https://emu8086.emuapps.com/) to compile and run the MS-DOS .com file
